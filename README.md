# Gobbler-SewerRat integration

**sayoko** is a service to ensure that only the latest version of each [Gobbler](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/gobbler) asset
is included in the [SewerRat](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/SewerRat) index.
It does so by adding a `.SewerRatignore` file to the subdirectories corresponding to all non-latest versions.
